# run this course locally ?

```{code-cell}
tools = require('../js/tools'); tools.init()
```

+++ {"slideshow": {"slide_type": ""}}

as usual you can enjoy this course with no local installation

if however you plan on reading this course locally on your computer, there are a few specific requirements that need to be fulfilled

+++ {"slideshow": {"slide_type": "slide"}}

## install as user as far as possible

+++

the commands below should be as far as possible run as a regular user  
if however, depending on your setup, they fail to complete because  
of a lack of permissions, you may need to invoke them as super-user  
by prepending them `sudo`; like in
```
sudo npm install -g ijavascript
```
instead of just
```
npm install -g ijavascript
```

## Jupyter JavaScript kernel

+++

* we use a JavaScript kernel - of course
* this requires `node` and `npm`, and can be installed with
  * `npm install -g ijavascript`
  * `ijsinstall`

+++ {"slideshow": {"slide_type": "slide"}}

## Jupyter extensions

this slideshow takes advantage of a few Jupyter extensions;  
most notably, `hide_input` is massively used to **hide**
the code that in turn produces code layout, so this one is rather critical

that being said, without any extension it is still possible to read the notebooks in regular - as opposed to slideshow - mode

+++ {"slideshow": {"slide_type": "slide"}}

* slideshow :
  * `pip install rise`  
* to read notebooks stored as markdown :  
  * `pip install jupytext[myst]`
* install Jupyter extensions
  * `pip install jupyter_contrib_nbextensions`  
  * `jupyter contrib nbextension install --user`   
* enable Jupyter's `hide_input` extension :  
  * `jupyter nbextension enable hide_input/main`
* (optional) enable Jupyter's `splitcell` extension  
  * `RUN jupyter nbextension enable splitcell/splitcell`
