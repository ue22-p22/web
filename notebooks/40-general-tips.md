# how to code: general tips

* first do not think on coding, but think about what do you want to achieve
* decompose the thing you are trying to achieve into smaller things  
  e.g. in the case of the spinning wheel, you need:
  * a button
  * circles
  * to change the color of a circle
  * to start/stop by pressing the button
  * and more ...
* try to achieve the smallest objectives first separately or independently
  * at this step the search engine can help :)
  * **BUT NEVER USE SOMETHING THAT YOU DO NOT UNDERSTAND**
  * **always** try to understand what you are using from others
  * **always** adapt the code you want to use from others
* gather all technics aquired in previous steps and combine them
* merge often
* enjoy ;)
