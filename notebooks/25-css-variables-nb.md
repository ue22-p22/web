# CSS custom properties

*aka* **CSS variables**

```{code-cell}
tools = require('../js/tools'); tools.init()
```

+++ {"slideshow": {"slide_type": "slide"}}

## why

* DRY: don't repeat yourself
* so far, we have not seen a way to "parametrize" things
* i.e. to use what other languages call *variables*
* and which btw, CSS calls *custom properties*

+++ {"slideshow": {"slide_type": "slide"}}

## example 1: DRY

imagine you'd like to define a custom class:

* where the padding and margin properties are equal
* where the text color matches the border color
* and you want to be able to customize this on specific elements

let's see how that can be done

```{code-cell}
---
hide_input: true
slideshow:
  slide_type: slide
tags: [hide-input]
---
tools.sample_from_stem('../samples/25-simple-vars', {'start_with': 'css'})
```

+++ {"slideshow": {"slide_type": "slide"}}

## example 2

imagine you'd like to define a custom header class:

* &lt;h1&gt; elements with the `dashed` class appear with a dashed underline
* this underline has default attributes (width, height, color)
* here again you want to be able to customize this on specific elements

so in other words, write a kind-of *parameterized* class, that can be tweaked from the outside  

let's see how that can be done

```{code-cell}
---
hide_input: true
slideshow:
  slide_type: slide
tags: [hide-input]
---
tools.sample_from_stem('../samples/25-dashed-headers', {'start_with': 'css', height: '35em'})
```

+++ {"slideshow": {"slide_type": "slide"}}

## how it works

* properties whose name starts with `--` are *custom* properties
  * this naming convention should resonate (a bit) with the *dunder* names in Python
* the way to 'solve' the value of such properties  
  * is the same as for regular properties
* you can use `var()` to get the value of such a property
* and - among others - `calc()` to perform computations
