## there is a library for everything

+++

* js cannot compete with traditional languages on CPU-intensive libraries
* **BUT** it does kill all competition as soon as a User-Interface is involved
* so bottom line is, all the common needs are covered

**example**

* I just picked a topic at random; say I need to display a calendar; I googled it and [found this](https://fullcalendar.io/)

in this notebook we see a selection of 2 libraries for visualzation that are really cool

+++

<div class="note">

this is a personal choice, there are **tons** of other interesting libraries available around

## three.js

+++

[`three.js`](https://threejs.org/) is a graphic library to create 3D virtual reality scenes

in a nutshell, to render a scene you need

* one or more objects
* one or more light sources
* a camera

it is pretty easy to get started with, if you [follow the tuto](https://threejs.org/docs/index.html#manual/en/introduction/Creating-a-scene)

### a selection

* the gallery of examples  
  <https://threejs.org/examples/#webgl_animation_cloth> (you can move around with the mouse)

* and tons of others,

## `d3.js`

+++

`d3.js` is a library for dataviz, its website is on <https://d3js.org/>

I strongly recommend a thorough visit of their [Gallery of examples](https://github.com/d3/d3/wiki/Gallery), where you will see mind-boggling examples of all kinds of ways to transform data into moving pixels

+++

d3 is based on a mental model that graphical objects (for example, elements in a <svg>) can be bound to the data, so that any change in the data automatically propagates to the graphical objects.

**WARNING**
`d3.js` admittedly has a rather steep learning curve, and is maybe not recommended as a first programming experience with js; keep it for the second shot :)


    
a cool way to play with d3 is to use <https://observablehq.com>, that was developped by the designer of `d3.js` and that offers a platform with live notebooks - or let us say live documents that very much look like Jupyter notebooks for JavaScript, except for small differences. Note that registration is required to actually create notebooks.
    
`observablehq` has its own [gallery of visualizations](https://observablehq.com/explore)
