## pythagore

+++

you are tasked to write a "graphical demonstration" for the Pythagorean Theorem, getting inspiration from the page below

the sample app is not responsive, you will need to open it in a separate window

```{code-cell}
:hide_input: true
:tags: [hide_input]

tools.sample_from_stem("../samples/44-pythagore/pythagore",
                       {sources_show: false, separate_height: '1000px', separate_width: '800px'})
```

## fibonacci and the golden number

you are asked to write a small app as a html+css+js that explores the neighbourhood between fibonacci numbers and the golden number, taking - as loose as you want - inspiration from the page below

here again the sample app is not responsive, you will need to open it in a separate window

**HINT** the slope of the 2 fixed rules is of course the golden ratio and its inverse

```{code-cell}
:hide_input: true
:tags: [hide_input]

// the minified version somehow was not working...
tools.sample_from_stem("../samples/44-fibonacci/fibonacci",
                       {sources_show: false, separate_height: '1000px', separate_width: '900px'})
```
