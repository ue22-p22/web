# practice : additional assignments

```{code-cell}
tools = require('../js/tools'); tools.init()
```

## tic-tac-toe

+++

write a tic-tac-toe game, something like this - there is a lot of room for improvement !

```{code-cell}
:hide_input: true
:tags: [hide_input]

tools.sample_from_stem("../samples/44-tic-tac-toe/tic-tac-toe",
                       {sources_show: false, separate_height: '400px', separate_width: '400px'})
```

## minesweeper

+++

write a minesweeper game; again you can do better than this :)

```{code-cell}
:hide_input: true
:tags: [hide_input]

tools.sample_from_stem("../samples/44-minesweeper/minesweeper",
                       {sources_show: false, separate_height: '400px', separate_width: '400px'})
```

+++ {"slideshow": {"slide_type": ""}}

## pythagore

+++

you are tasked to write a "graphical demonstration" for the Pythagorean Theorem, getting inspiration from the page below

the sample app is not responsive, you will need to open it in a separate window

```{code-cell}
:hide_input: true
:tags: [hide_input]

tools.sample_from_stem("../samples/44-pythagore/pythagore",
                       {sources_show: false, separate_height: '1000px', separate_width: '800px'})
```

+++ {"slideshow": {"slide_type": ""}}

## fibonacci and the golden number

you are asked to write a small app as a html+css+js that explores the neighbourhood between fibonacci numbers and the golden number, taking - as loose as you want - inspiration from the page below

here again the sample app is not responsive, you will need to open it in a separate window

**HINT** the slope of the 2 fixed rules is of course the golden ratio and its inverse

```{code-cell}
:hide_input: true
:tags: [hide_input]

// the minified version somehow was not working...
tools.sample_from_stem("../samples/44-fibonacci/fibonacci",
                       {sources_show: false, separate_height: '1000px', separate_width: '900px'})
```

## a snake

+++

* clone the github repo from <https://github.com/patorjk/JavaScript-Snake.git>
* open `index.html` in your browser - check that the game works for you
* could you read the code ?  
  if not what percentage can you read ?

* imagine some change that you'd like to make on the game  
  be it in terms of colors, speed, behaviour, whatever you  
  think could improve the game  
  are you able to implement that change ?
